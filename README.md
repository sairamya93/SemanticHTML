# SemanticHTML
Semantic Code means code that is easy to draw logical meaning from.
This is particularly important with HTML, as Screen Readers use Semantic HTML tags to navigate and draw meaning from a web page for visually impaired users.
Search engine web crawlers also use HTML tags to get information from your page (for example the information in a pages <title> tags) to rank web pages in search results.
Using Semantic HTML makes web pages more accessible
